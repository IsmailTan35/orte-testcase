# Project Name - Dockerized Full Stack Application

This document explains how to use Docker Compose to run a full stack application containing a MySQL database container, phpMyAdmin container, Node.js server container, and React framework container.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your computer.

- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Usage

1. Go to your project's root directory and create a `docker-compose.yml` file or use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file in this repository.

2. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file and configure the requirements for the MySQL container. Set up details like the root password, database name, MySQL users, and passwords.

3. In your terminal, navigate to your project's root directory and run the following command to start the project:

   ``bash
   docker-compose up -d

The -d flag runs the containers in detached mode.

4. You can verify that the MySQL container has been successfully started by using the following command:

   ``bash
   docker-compose ps

5. Configure your Node.js application to connect to the MySQL container. Your Node.js application will need to connect to the Docker network (e.g., docker_default).

6. Add the necessary steps to run your application to your README file.

7. When you're done, you can stop the containers using the following command:

   ``bash
   docker-compose down
